      <description>We start tracing from GetTcpTable, which is just a wrapper over GetTcpTableInternal. This function is responsible for processing the TCP table data returned from a call to NsiAllocateAndGetTable .
NsiAllocateAndGetTable carries our analysis to the kernel side, by invoking the handler for 0x12001B IOCTL code of the nsiproxy.sys
nsiproxy is a broker between the user mode clients and the kernel mode nsi providers, let&#39;s take a look at nsiproxy!NsippDispatch to see which provider it will have to trigger in our case.</description>

She then wanted to range through her pages by their weight, like so:
{{ range .</description>
